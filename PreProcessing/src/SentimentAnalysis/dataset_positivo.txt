I:8493	1	But, in all honesty, I thought this was an amazing film long before I knew what people would be saying about it (I saw it the day it opened and knew nothing about it.
I:8493	2	I'm sure most people have seen it and most people know what its about.
I:8493	3	I never really thought about them as far as artistic matters are concerned.
I:8493	4	Now after all the years since its release I've learned a lot about movies and can appreciate them on another level.
I:8493	5	So, thanks to Pulp Fiction I have a great appreciation for movies.
I:8493	6	as entertainment and now as art as well.
I:8493	7	watch movies that I had seen before, I can watch them with a new appreciation and understanding.
I:8493	8	so that is why Pulp Fiction is my favorite movie and one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8493	9	"I enjoyed this movie.
I:8493	10	it was unpredictable and exciting throughout.
I:8493	11	but I liked the miracle and Bruce Willis scenes too.
I:8493	12	Fortunately, the use of guns as overly powerful extensions of will is well.
I:8493	13	"If somebody pointed a gun at me and said,""You gotta have an opinion .
I:8493	14	about what the best movie of the 90s is"" I'd tell them to point that gun away from my head before it accidently goes off.
I:8493	15	i think it is the funniest movie I've seen that actually doesn't go in the comedy section at the video store.
I:8493	16	When he dies they will refer to him first and foremost as the director of PULP FICTION.
I:8493	17	His place in history as one of the great directors of cinema is secured with this film."
I:8493	18	Samuel L Jackson remains the stand out and some of the dialogue is still very, very funny.
I:8493	19	This time I was not so impressed by Ms Thurman and Mr Travolta's twist scene but still shuddered at the adrenaline shot to the heart.
I:8493	20	I would watch Mr Jackson again as he remains for me, a superb actor, but not the movie in full.
I:8493	21	Pulp Fiction is a vital, energetic, unique (I know Tarantino borrows a lot of his ideas, but so does everyone, and I'll argue with anyone who says his usage of them is not original), and unflinching film.
I:8493	22	work in this movie a LOT more entertaining than in any of the post.
I:8493	23	I like this one, but I feel he's got another one that could even go further.
I:8493	24	i liked the direction.
I:8493	25	I liked all of the actors.
I:8493	26	And I liked the music.
I:8493	27	You've finally made a film that makes killing people really sexy.
I:8493	28	Hollywood, how do you do it???
I:8493	29	Must watch if you are a fan of any of the cast.
I:8493	30	I enjoy it every time I watch.
I:8493	31	This is the classic Tarantino film and it is really great.
I:8493	32	ray version, then I can tell you, ""DO IT!""
I:8493	33	This movie is a must see and in my opinion it should be in every Tarantion's fans collection.
I:8493	34	The Blu Ray is great!!
I:8493	35	it comes with everything!
I:8493	36	The extra features!
I:8493	37	All was good with the movie!
I:8493	38	Pulp Fiction is still regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made, and why should it change from that rank?
I:8493	39	The movie can be really funny in certain areas while giving you the classic drama feel, along with a recreation of how people seem to live.
I:8493	40	Way to ruin the meaning of quality!)
I:8493	41	So very unique and different from other films.
I:8493	42	for starters, people will love the transfer.
I:8493	43	One of the best films of the decade, this thing started a wave of ' gritty/cool, pop culture/guns.
I:8493	44	Completely, totally entertaining, this movie has quite literally helped to define Generation X. Anyone in 2002 between the ages of approximately 25.43, probably has a soft spot for this movie.
I:8493	45	like alot of people, I saw this thing about 5 times in the theatre and it was always a great experience.
I:8493	46	and that's something I've rarely felt since, if ever.
I:8493	47	It's one of those movies I'd love to see again for the first time.
I:8493	48	view in like 1995, so I am eager to once again see it in its widescreen, dolby.
I:8493	49	"If you want a action, adventure, and comedy; this is the movie to own.
I:8493	50	This is one of the most funny movies.
I:8493	51	I'm not going to spoil it for anybody that hasn't watched it but, you'll want to own it and watch it again and again and again.
I:8493	52	"Pulp Fiction has often been hailed as one of the greatest films made.
I:8493	53	certainly one of the best in modern times (along with Fargo, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the Star Wars trilogy).
I:8493	54	And it is easy to see why.
I:8493	55	Beside being a great film, it catapulted Tarantino into the public's eye, revived the dead career of John Travolta, introduced us to Tim Roth, reminded us of Harvey Keitel and Ving Rhames, gave us so many catch phrases, and ingrained itself into American pop culture.
I:8493	56	This is arguably Tarantino's best film (only Reservoir Dogs can compete with it) and after watching it, there is little room for doubt about the greatness of the film.
I:8493	57	As a film, volumes can be written on it, and I can't say enough of it here.
I:8493	58	But has it been worth the wait?
I:8493	59	Disc 1 contains the movie and an enhanced trivia track.
I:8493	60	Anyone who has seen Pulp Fiction (or any Tarantino movie for that matter), knows how important music is to the film.
I:8493	61	This option allows you to jump to the various music selections in the film.
I:8493	62	The dvd was worth the wait (even without a commentary track), and it is finally nice to see dvd worthy of the film."
I:8493	63	This is the best movie ever!!
I:8493	64	Every single minute of this film is beautiful.
I:8493	65	This movie is beautifully well shot.
I:8493	66	This is Quentin Tarantino at his best!!
I:8493	67	Pulp Fiction, besides (arguably) being the best Tarantino movie so far,Pulp Fiction (Two.
I:8493	68	disc Collector's Edition)was/is one of the best packaged DVDs ever.
I:8493	69	I placed the order, the plan being to simply replace the DVD's movie disc with the Blu and get the best of both.
I:8493	70	Anyone who's watched the Blu issues of '2001' or the Blu James Bond Collection or The Godfather probably knows what I'm talking about.
I:8493	71	Its like someone washed the camera's lens and everything that was to be sharp is even more so and all shades are nuances are now perfectly rendered.
I:8493	72	Add to that the spectacular Loseless DTS.
I:8493	73	rOM features and adds 2 new featurettes containing more recent interviews with the cast and some critics discussion on the movie's role in the history of cinematography.
I:8493	74	i am happy with my purchase.
I:8493	75	It is also an excellent movie!
I:8493	76	Pulp Fiction is still raw, captivating, and completely mindblowing to this day.
I:8493	77	This is the only Quentin Taritino film that I truly adore, the whole cast are at their best here especially John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis.
I:8493	78	If you love a long and complicated film then Pulp Fiction is for you.
I:8493	79	I highly recommend it.
I:8493	80	This is pure genius and Tarantino pulled out all the stops in his second movie.
I:8493	81	He beautifully crafted a modern day masterpiece, interweaving multiple story lines and characters.
I:8493	82	Tarantino is the king of interesting dialogue.
I:8493	83	faced, get the job done, and get the heck out with perfect precision.
I:8493	84	To show the genius of Tarantino, he takes this situation which is in any other circumstance would be dead serious, and he makes it funny.
I:8493	85	this movie is perfect in everyway.
I:8493	86	It would be the best decision you have ever made.
I:8493	87	Besides the acting of Travolta and Jackson, the charm of Uma, the story gets you completely, so you will never forget this movie, both dramatic and funny, very well written and directed.
I:8493	88	definition looks amazing on this Pulp Fiction Blu.
I:8493	89	Wish that the extra features were in HD.
I:8493	90	This is an absolute classic cult movie.
I:8493	91	It certainly worth watch at least once, or in my case at least a few times a year.
I:8493	92	Funny, crude, a bit violent, great cast, and just down right fun.
I:8493	93	Interesting movie, plenty of action and comedy combine.
I:8493	94	Perfect actors for each roll, and very detailed story line.
I:8493	95	This movie is obviously great.
I:8493	96	It has an all star cast.
I:8493	97	John travolta, and Uma Thurman are great.
I:8493	98	My favorite parts are with Samuel L. Jackson.
I:8493	99	If you like Quentin Tarantino, see this movie.
I:8493	100	I really liked this movie!
